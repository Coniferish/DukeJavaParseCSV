# DukeJavaParseCSV

**Author:** John Jennings

This exercise is adapted from https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming. 
The program was initially configured to run with Duke's "BlueJ" IDE (see first commit), but has been adapted to run with Maven. The main purpose in doing this exercise was to go through the process of looking up new classes to use and adapting the app to run locally.

https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/ was used as a reference for using Maven.


**General Description:** This program opens a CSV file and searches for country information for "Nauru", lists countries that export both "fish" and "nuts", and calculates the number of countries that export "sugar".


Run with `java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar`
