# DukeJavaParseCSV

**Author:** John Jennings

This exercise is from https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming. 
The program was initially configured to run with Duke's "BlueJ" IDE (see first commit), but has been adapted to run normally with Maven.

https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/ was used as a reference for using Maven.


**General Description:** This program opens a CSV file and searches for country information for "Nauru", lists countries that export both "fish" and "nuts", and calculates the number of countries that export "sugar".


Run with `java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar`
